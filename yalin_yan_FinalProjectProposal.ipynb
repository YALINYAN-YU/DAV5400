Basically, in the Introduction you are trying to make the reader understand why the research questions you are going to propose are relevant and should be of interest to them.*"

    "    I have found and downloaded 2 sets of data in from the World Health Organization, as the following website:\n",
    "    http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.52?lang=en\n",

    "The first set of data describe in which year which religion of the world and which country the propotions of infants exclusively breastfed \n",
    "for the first six months of life, and the propotions of Early initiation of breastfeeding of all the infants. we can analysis the data to conclude the relationships between each 2 factors from the above metioned ones.\n",
    "The second set of data describe the people's thinness status, which can be indicated by the BMI, in different time, religions, age, sex and income status(low, middle-low, middle-high,high)\n",
    "These two set of data have some factors are same such as the time and religion, and they are all describing the healthy problems of people all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.research question:\n",
    "(1)What is the relationship between the \"infrants exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life \" related with their BMI when they grow up?\n",
    "(2)How the income status influce people's thinness?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Data to be used:\n",
    "One of the data is in Excel and another is in the form of csv,download from the following website:\n",
    "http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.52?lang=en\n",

    "4.I think this 2 dataset meet the requirements of : a) realistic; and b) feasible, and  I have the following reasons:\n",
    "(1)This two dataset all present the healthy problems that humankind are facing today, and health stutas is the basic for everything, only our next generation have a very good body and health condition, we can devote more human resource to the project of humankind's civilisation and advancement, so to research the approch to improve people's health have a significant meaning;\n",
    "(2)These two date set are related to each other, we can easily related a people's nutrition in the baby age to his or her thinness when they grow up. so for gorvenment to make the decision to spend same amount of money to improve the health, we can know that which decision is more meaningful, to devote the money to the heath care to the baby age or adult age? So i regard this as quite realistic and feasible. \n",
